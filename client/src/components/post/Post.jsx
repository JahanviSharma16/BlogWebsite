      <p className="postDesc">The stunning reality is that God’s heart has never changed. He loves you and everyone around you the same way. It doesn’t matter who we are or what we’ve done. Is anything keeping you from taking the next step in your personal journey with Jesus? Are there people in your life right now that need to hear what God is doing in your life? In the sermon I asked some questions that get at the heart of our current experience of Jesus. Do we carry shame from a sin in the past? Do we have guilt from a sin in the present? Do we carry shame from struggling with the same sin repeatedly? Are we following a spiritual path that is no longer working because it is a deviation from the way of Jesus and His gospel?</p>
